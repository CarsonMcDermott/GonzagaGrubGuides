# GonzagaGrubGuides

Gonzaga Grub Guides is a restaurant review website, intended for the students of Gonzaga and locals nearby. Those using GonzagaGrubGuides will be able to search and review restaurants nearby based around rating or name. In addition to this, users will be able to find a 
random restaurant from the database if inspired to do so. Gonzaga Grub Guides will be pre-loaded with all of the nearby resturants/shops that take Bulldog Bucks (Gonzaga's dining currency) as of Fall 2023. Additional restaurants will be added by users as necessary.

Users of Gonzaga Grub Guides will be able to view the restaurant online, using the link:
