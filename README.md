# GonzagaGrubGuides

Gonzaga Grub Guides is a restaurant review website, intended for the students of Gonzaga and locals nearby. Those using GonzagaGrubGuides will be able to search and review local restaurants nearby based on rating or name. In addition to this, users will be able to find a 
random restaurant from the database if inspired to do so. Gonzaga Grub Guides will be pre-loaded with <em>most</em> of the nearby restaurants/shops that take Bulldog Bucks (Gonzaga's dining currency) as of Fall 2023. Additional restaurants will be added by users as necessary.

Developed by Brady Keely, Carson McDermott, and Maalik Brown for CPSC 332-01 Website Development, Fall 2023.
